Azure SDK for JavaScript

This repository is for the Azure SDK for JavaScript (Node.js & Browser). It contains libraries for the breadth of Azure services. Management libraries are packages that you would use to provision and manage Azure resources. Client libraries are packages that you would use to consume these resources and interact with them.

Getting started

A few helpful resources to get started are:

The readme for each package contains code samples and package information. This readme can be found in the corresponding package folder under the folder of the service of your choice in the /sdk folder of this repository. The same readme file can be found on the landing page for the package in npm.

The API reference documentation of the latest versions of these packages, can be found at our public developer docs.

The API reference documentation of older versions, can be found in our versioned developer docs.

Each service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:

Client

Management

NOTE: Some of these packages have beta versions. If you need to ensure your code is ready for production, use one of the stable, non-beta packages.

Client

Given an Azure resource already exists, you would use the client libraries to consume it and interact with it.
Most of these libraries follow the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for JavaScript & TypeScript and share a number of core functionalities such as retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. Others will be updated in the near future to follow the guidelines as well.

To get a list of all client libraries that follow the new guidelines, please visit our Azure SDK releases page.

Management

Management libraries enable you to provision and manage Azure resources via the Azure Resource Manager i.e. ARM. You can recognize these libraries by @azure/arm- in their package names. These are purely auto-generated based on the swagger files that represent the APIs for resource management.

Newer versions of these libraries follow the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for TypeScript. These new versions provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more. A few helpful resources to get started with these are:

List of management libraries that follow the new guidelines

Documentation and code samples.

Migration guide that shows how to transition from older versions of libraries.

NOTE: If you are experiencing authentication issues with the management libraries after upgrading certain packages, it's possible that you upgraded to the new versions of SDK without changing the authentication code, please refer to the migration guide mentioned above for proper instructions.
