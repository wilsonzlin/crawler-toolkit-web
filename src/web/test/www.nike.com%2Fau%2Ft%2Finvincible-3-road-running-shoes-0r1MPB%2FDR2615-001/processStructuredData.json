Within 6 weeks of light wear the tread on the bottom of the shoe was separating from the sole and the sole itself was also separating from the upper. I contacted Nike about warranty coverage and they refused to help. I didn’t have a receipt as I received them as a Christmas gift and that disqualifies me from receiving warranty coverage. Why Nike needs a receipt to stand behind the products it manufactures is beyond me.",
