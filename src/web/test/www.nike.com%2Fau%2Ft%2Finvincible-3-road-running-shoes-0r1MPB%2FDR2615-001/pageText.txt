Poor Quality

MatthewH468821266 - 09 Mar 2024

Love the looks and comfort but the quality of the pair I received is terrible. Within 6 weeks of light wear the tread on the bottom of the shoe was separating from the sole and the sole itself was also separating from the upper. I contacted Nike about warranty coverage and they refused to help. I didn‚Äôt have a receipt as I received them as a Christmas gift and that disqualifies me from receiving warranty coverage. Why Nike needs a receipt to stand behind the products it manufactures is beyond me.

Bad lock down/Heel slippage

BrayanR761677126 - 09 Mar 2024

Good shoe very cushioning, Just disappointed on the heel slippage even with runners knot still can get a good lock down looking forward for better heel support for upcoming version !!

Amazing

JonathanS304450340 - 08 Mar 2024

I‚Äôve been running in Infintity 3‚Äôs and 4‚Äôs and loved them so didn‚Äôt think I needed Invincible‚Äôs. 20 seconds into putting them on, I knew why I needed them. Amazing shoes and while I love the Infinity‚Äôs and will use on shorter runs, I will definitely be buying more Invincible‚Äôs moving forward
