A healthy lunch in no time

I've had Aussielent on subscription for lunch for years.

I blend up a large batch of kale, english spinach, cucumber, banana and mint (similar to Boost Juice Caribean Green) and then freeze it in 250ml plastic containers. For lunch I microwave them for 1 minute then drop them straight into a shaker cup with Aussielent. If I'm working away from home, I drop it in frozen and it melts by lunch time. This way I'm getting all my greens as well as the other nutrients. The banana and cucumber cover any coarseness in the Aussielent. Overall its alkaline which settles my stomach. I've been doing this for years now.

The above could be made into a freezer product in supermarkets - green protein smoothies at home - just add water. I don't have time to do it.

I do think Qota could be improved. Could milk products be eliminated? For climate reasons we should minimise cows.

Make it the night before

I make this up the night before and it completely gets rid of the powdery texture. I’ve found even letting it rest in the fridge for an hour before drinking significantly improves the texture and taste. I also mix it with half low fat milk and half water, it adds a bit of sweetness without it getting too thick this way.

I have it every morning for breakfast,i drink it in the shower. I’m actually eating breakfast consistently for the first time in my life. Love it, recommend it to everyone. Salted Caramel and chocolate flavours are my faves.

Powdery texture, bland flavour

Would not purchase again. Loved the Aussielent premade drinks, this doesn't come remotely close. Loved the original Soylent brand drinks too. This is a hard pass from me. 2 stars because I'll stomach it instead of throwing it in the bin.

Hi Courtney,

thanks for leaving a review! Sorry you didn't enjoy the powder. The powders are a completely different product/ingredients to the RTDs and we do find people tend to strongly prefer one over the other.

A measuring cup with the first order would've been useful.

I bought this product after reading online that it was similar to Huel. It doesn’t even come close. The flavour and texture leave a lot to be desired.

not smooth

The flavour is very weak and the consistency not smooth. The bags don't come with a scoop which is inconvenient and the shaker with a whisk ball doesn't get rid of lumps as well as the shakers that have a grid.
